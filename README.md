# mishahx

👋 Welcome to **mishahx** — a quiet forge of ideas, experiments, and engineering craftsmanship.

While most of our work stays behind the curtain 🔐, each line of code here follows one goal:

> **To build by example.**  

🛠️ Focus areas include:
- Private R&D and prototypes
- Infrastructure and DevOps workflows
- Clean, scalable backend design

🌟 _Inspired by the name "Mishal" — meaning **example** — this space reflects the belief that innovation doesn't always have to be loud to be powerful._
